    <br>
    <p>Q1.What is Exception in Java?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ans-In Java, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program 
        that disrupts its normal flow. 
        It represents an exceptional condition or error that can be handled by the program.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Q2.What is Exception Handling?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ans-Exception handling in Java is a mechanism that allows you to handle and
         manage runtime errors and exceptional situations that may occur during program
          execution. It involves using try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions, 
          preventing program crashes and providing alternative paths of execution when an
           exception occurs.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Q3.What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions and Error?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ans-Checked exceptions are enforced by the compiler and require explicit handling 
        or declaration. Unchecked exceptions do not need to be explicitly caught or 
        declared and are typically caused by programming errors. Errors indicate
         serious system or environment failures and should not be caught or handled.</p>
         <br>

    <p>Q4.What are the difference between throw and throws in Java?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ans-throw is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method, while throws 
        is used in a method declaration to specify the exceptions that the method might
         throw, delegating the responsibility of handling them to the caller. </p>
         <br>
    <p>Q5.What is multithreading in Java? mention its advantages</p>
    <br>
    <p>Multithreading in Java allows for concurrent execution of tasks, 
        leading to improved performance, responsiveness, efficient resource management,
         simultaneous task execution, simplified program design, and support for 
         asynchronous programming.</p>
         <br>
    <p>Q7.How can you handle exceptions in Java? </p>
    <br>
    <p>Ans-
        In Java, exceptions can be handled using try-catch blocks. Here's how exception
         handling is done:
        
        try block: The code that may throw an exception is placed inside a try block. 
        If an exception occurs within the try block, the control is transferred to the
        corresponding catch block.
        
        catch block: The catch block is used to catch and handle specific types of 
        exceptions. It specifies the exception type that it can handle and includes the 
        code to handle the exception. Multiple catch blocks can be used to handle 
        different types of exceptions.
        
        finally block: The finally block is an optional block that follows the try-catch 
        block. It is used to specify code that must be executed regardless of whether 
        an exception occurred or not. The finally block is typically used to release 
        resources or perform cleanup tasks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Q8.What is Thread in Java?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ans-In Java, a thread represents an independent unit of execution within a program.
             It is a lightweight process that can execute concurrently with other threads,
            allowing for concurrent and parallel execution of tasks. 
            Threads enable multitasking and allow different parts of a program to run
            concurrently, enhancing performance and responsiveness.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Q9. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?</p>
        <br>
        <p>1- Extending the Thread class: By extending the Thread class, you can create a
         new class that acts as a thread. This approach requires overriding the run()
          method in the subclass, which contains the code that will be executed when the 
          thread is started. To start the thread, you create an instance of the subclass 
          and call its start() method.</p>
        <p>2- Implementing the Runnable interface: Implementing the Runnable interface 
            allows you to separate the thread's behavior from the class hierarchy. 
            This approach involves creating a separate class that implements the Runnable 
            interface and implementing the run() method in that class.
            Then, you can create an instance of the class and pass it to a 
            Thread object for execution.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Q10.What do you mean by garbage collection?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Garbage collection in Java is an automatic memory management process that 
            frees up memory by removing unreferenced objects. It prevents memory leaks
            and ensures efficient memory usage without requiring manual memory 
            deallocation by developers.</p>
